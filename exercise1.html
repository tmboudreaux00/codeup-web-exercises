        <p>HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language.</em></p>
        <p>It is the language that is used to structure web pages. HTML contains the content of a web page which users can see, and also some information that the user's browser interprets to format the content, but doesn't explicitly show to the user.
            Elements and Tags</p>
        These are called element tags. They inform the browser how to display the page. They look like this: &lt;div&gt;
         They almost always come with a closing tag somewhere later that looks like this: &lt;/div&gt;
        Whatever is between the <span>opening tag and the closing tag</span> is called an element. Let's create some...
        In order to make a main header, we wrap the content of the header in an &lt;h1&gt; tag.
        And to set some content as a paragraph element, we use &lt;p&gt; tags.
